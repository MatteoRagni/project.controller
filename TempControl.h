/**
 * \brief Class for the temperature controller
 *
 * The class handles the control for the temperature. It is actually a system in the form:
 *
 *      x' = f(x, c, r)        x : temperature plant state. We have a sensor for it
 *      c' = 0                 c : chiller state
 *      r' = 0                 r : resistance state
 *      t' = s * LOOP_TIMING   t : counter for alarm state
 *      s' = 0                 s : derivative of the timer
 *
 * This dynamic equation may evolve with jumps if those conditions are reached:
 *
 *      Condition: s != -1 and t ≤ Tset - Tdelta
 *      x+ = x
 *      c+ = 0
 *      r+ = 1 * r_enabled
 *      t+ = 0
 *      s+ = -1
 *
 *      Condition: s != 1 and t ≥ Tset + Tdelta
 *      x+ = x
 *      c+ = 1 * c_enabled
 *      r+ = 0
 *      t+ = 0
 *      s+ = 1
 *
 *      Condition: (s == 1 and t ≤ Tset) or (s == -1 and t ≥ Tset)
 *      x+ = x
 *      c+ = 0
 *      r+ = 0
 *      t+ = 0
 *      s+ = 0
 *
 *      Condition abs(t) ≥ alarm_threshold and TEMP_CTRL = 1
 *      An error is raised in the state machine and all the system is shut down
